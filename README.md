# Contact Manager

#### From the front page, support user logins, and account creation.
#### Once logged in, users can create, update, retrieve and delete contacts.
#### Contacts must have at least names and e-mails.

#### Use a LAMP stack.  (Hint: Deploy the in-class project yourself and look at it to understand LAMP stacks.)
#### Deploy the project remotely.
#### Have a DNS address.
#### Use Web pages that use JSON-formatted APIs to connect to a PHP-brokered database backend, all on that server.
#### Actually search the database - do not cache all contacts client-side.
